Intracortical brain-computer-interface controlled flight simulation. Enabled the participant to fly a virtual drone using their brain signals. Wrote backend Python code that receives and processes decoded neural signals, controls game logic, and interfaces with a front-end simulation running Microsoftâ€™s AirSim flight simulator in Unity. Ran 3 research sessions with the participant to test different control schemes for ease of use.
